In this lesson, you will learn: 

- How to write queries using multiple filter conditions
- The difference between combining filters using AND and OR
- How to write queries that prioritize filter conditions over others using brackets


Combining three filter conditions using AND
SELECT *

FROM ba_flights

WHERE total_passengers > 100 -- we need all three of these conditions to be true
			AND departure_city = 'London' -- note how we format the query for readability
			AND arrival_city = 'Madrid'
;

Combining the IN operator and excluding NULL values
SELECT *

FROM ba_flights

WHERE airline IS NOT NULL -- queries sometimes have a large number of conditions
			AND departure_city = 'London' -- neat indenting makes it easy to understand even complicated queries
			AND arrival_city IN('Lisbon', 'Madrid')
;

Exercise
Q. Select all rows that depart from London or Madrid, and the flight status is not equal to “Cancelled” from the British Airways flights table.
A. 
SELECT *

FROM ba_flights

WHERE departure_city IN ('Madrid', 'London')
			AND status != 'Cancelled' -- not cancelled can also be written NOT (status = 'Cancelled')
;

Combining two filter conditions using OR
SELECT
	flight_number,
	airline,
	departure_city,
	arrival_city,
	revenue_from_baggage

FROM ba_flights 

WHERE departure_city = 'Aberdeen' -- flights leaving from or arrive at Aberdeen
			OR arrival_city = 'Aberdeen'
;

Exercise
Q. Select all columns for flights with more than 200 passengers or more than 3,000 in baggage weight from the British Airways flights table.
A. 
SELECT *
       
FROM ba_flights

WHERE total_passengers > 200
			OR baggage_weight > 3000
;

Combining an OR statement with a third condition
-- inspect the output of this query and visually fact check a few rows
SELECT flight_number,
			 airline,
			 departure_city,
			 arrival_city

FROM ba_flights
-- we want any record that
-- is an aberdeen flight (coming or going)
-- AND has more than 10,000 baggage revenue
WHERE (departure_city = 'Aberdeen' 
			OR arrival_city = 'Aberbeen')
			AND revenue_from_baggage > 10000
;

Question: What will brackets do when you place them around a combination of two filter conditions combined with AND or OR? 
e.g. WHERE (condition1 AND condition2) OR (condition3 AND condition4) AND condition5

Answer
Brackets prioritize everything within the brackets over the code outside the brackets. 
This means the combination of filters within the brackets will run first and the remaining filter conditions will run after. 




Lesson Summary
Here is a quick recap of key points to take away from this lesson: 

AND combines filter conditions where both must be met for the rows to show in the query result.
OR combines filter conditions where only one condition needs to be met for the rows to show in the query result.
Placing brackets around the conditions combined by the AND or OR clause prioritizes the conditions within the brackets first.
