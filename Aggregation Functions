Overview of aggregation functions
Aggregation                      Description
SUM(<column_name>)               calculates the sum of values
AVG(<column_name>)               calculates the average of a set of values
MAX(<column_name>)               gets the maximum value in a set of values
MIN(<column_name>)               gets the minimum value in a set of values
COUNT(<column_name>)             counts rows in a specified table or view
COUNT(DISTINCT <column_name>)    counts the number of unique values 

Applying aggregation functions in SELECT
SELECT SUM(conversions) AS total_conversions

FROM meta_revenue
;

Combining aggregation functions using arithmetic operators
SELECT SUM(revenue)/SUM(conversions) AS revenue_per_conversion

FROM meta_revenue
;
