Group by using a single group
-- it is not strictly necessary to include the group by variable in the select statement
-- but the query output is not very readable or intuitive without it.
SELECT sales_team, 
			 SUM(conversions) AS total_conversions

FROM meta_revenue

GROUP BY sales_team
;

Group by using multiple groups
-- rule of thumb: include variables you are grouping by in the select statement
SELECT parent_company,
			 sales_team,
			 SUM(conversions) AS total_conversions

FROM meta_revenue

GROUP BY parent_company,
			   sales_team,
;

Exercise
Select the average number of clicks that have been generated by each sales team for the year 2022
SELECT sales_team,
			 AVG(clicks) AS avg_clicks

FROM meta_revenue

WHERE years = 2022 -- if you put the value 2022 in quotes ('2022') SQL will still understand

GROUP BY sales_team
;
