Question #1: 
What is the number of order items by each business unit (Nike Official and Nike Vintage)?

Hint/s
How do we combine data together from two separate data sources?
How can we assign a text to a column?

Solution
SELECT 'Nike Official' AS business_unit,
			 COUNT(DISTINCT order_item_id) AS num_items
       
FROM order_items

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Nike Vintage' AS business_unit,
			 COUNT(DISTINCT order_item_id) AS num_items
       
FROM order_items_vintage

Question #2: 
What is the number of order items sold with a discount (sales price being smaller than retail price) by each business unit (Nike Official and Nike Vintage)? What is the total revenue generated from these items?

Hint/s
Which columns are needed in our query results?
How do you combine two data sources with the same number of columns into a single query result?

Solution

SELECT 'Nike Official' AS business_unit,
			 COUNT(DISTINCT order_items.order_item_id) AS num_items,
       SUM(order_items.sale_price) AS total_revenue
       
FROM order_items
		 LEFT JOIN products ON order_items.product_id = products.product_id

WHERE order_items.sale_price < products.retail_price

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Nike Vintage' AS business_unit,
			 COUNT(DISTINCT order_items_vintage.order_item_id) AS num_items,
       SUM(order_items_vintage.sale_price) AS total_revenue
       
FROM order_items_vintage
		 LEFT JOIN products ON order_items_vintage.product_id = products.product_id

WHERE order_items_vintage.sale_price < products.retail_price
