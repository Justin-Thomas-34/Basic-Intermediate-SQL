Question #1:

How do you combine two conditions together in your filter if only one condition needs to be correct?

-- we need the flight_id column from ba_flights
SELECT flight_id

FROM ba_flights

WHERE total_passengers = 0 -- "O total passengers or distance 0"
			OR distance_flown = 0 -- need to use the OR operator (either/both condition can be true)
;

Question #2: 
Select the unique arrival cities that British Airways is flying to when departing from London

Hint/s
How do you select unique values?
What column is used to identify the flights departure?

Question #3: 
Select the flight numbers, flight date, and departure city for flights that fly to Madrid, Lisbon, Port of Spain, or Tel Aviv
Hint/s
How do you filter for text columns?

			AND (revenue_from_baggage = 0 OR total_passengers = 0) -- either or both can be true in this case
;
