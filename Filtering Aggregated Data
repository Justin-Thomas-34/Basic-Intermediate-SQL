In this lesson, you will learn: 
- How to write queries that filter based on aggregated values
- How to sort your query result
- How to limit the number of rows you will receive in your query result

Filtering aggregated data using HAVING
SELECT sales_team,
			 SUM(impressions) AS total_impressions

FROM meta_revenue

WHERE years = 2022

GROUP BY sales_team
-- meta_revenue gets aggregated into a summary table we can further filter down!
HAVING SUM(impressions) > 27500000
;


Rule of Thumb: Only apply HAVING if you need to filter aggregated data, otherwise use WHERE


Exercise
How much revenue did Instagram and Facebook generate per year separately? Only include years where Instagram and Facebook generated above 500 million revenue in a year.

Note: the revenue columns is already shown in millions 

SELECT years, 
			 parent_company, 
       SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue 
       
FROM meta_revenue

GROUP BY years, 
			   parent_company
-- any time you need to filter on an aggregated number - you'll need the HAVING clause
HAVING SUM(revenue) > 500
;
